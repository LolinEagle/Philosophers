# Philosophers
This project is about threading a process and mutexes.

## Deployment
To deploy this project run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LolinEagle/Philosophers && cd Philosophers/philo && make
```

## Arguments
Your program should take the following arguments :
```bash
./philo <numberOfPhilosophers> <timeToDie> <timeToEat> <timeToSleep> [numberOfTimes]
```
numberOfPhilosophers : The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.

timeToDie (in milliseconds) : If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.

timeToEat (in milliseconds) : The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.

timeToSleep (in milliseconds) : The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.

numberOfTimes (optional argument) : If all philosophers have eaten at least numberOfTimes times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies
